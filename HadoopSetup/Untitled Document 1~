1. Change Bash Prompt Coz the default sucks!

2. Add user to Sudo Group

sudo adduser <username> sudo

3. Check the users for sudo Group

getent group groupname


4. Download VMWare Player from the website.. it comes in as a .bundle file.. Set properties to execute and install it using the command

sudo sh *filename*.bundle

5.I need Spark that comes precompiled with CDH 4.. and CDH 4 needs Java 7.. But Ubunto 12 comes default bundled with Java 6... so Upgrading Java

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer

6. Set JAVA_HOME 

These are the links I found..
/usr/bin/java ----------->
/etc/alternatives/java ------>
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java

I had some confusion whether I had JDK installed or just the JRE.. but because I was able to javac -version I assumed I had the JDK installed
 
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
