Split the Train and Test Data into Multiple Files:

split -l 30000 -d -a 6 ../train.csv t
split -l 30000 -d -a 6 ../test.csv t

Once the splitting is done remove the first line from the first file from both the test and train splits.
This line is the header.

1. Train data needs to be split so that we can train a tree on each split and based on that tree we will evaluate the entire test dataset.
2. Finally we will take the mode of the decisions and plug that as the final decision for the test data


set(chunk2.C1)
set(chunk2.banner_pos)
set(chunk2.site_category)
set(chunk2.device_type)
set(chunk2.device_conn_type)
set(chunk2.C15)
set(chunk2.C16)
set(chunk2.C18)
set(chunk2.C19)
set(chunk2.C21)
